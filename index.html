      <h2>What is Digital Business?</h2>
      <p class="intro">Digital businesses use technology to create new value in business models,
        customer experiences and the internal capabilities that support its core operations.
         The term includes both digital-only brands and traditional players
        that are transforming their businesses with digital technologies.</p>

        <h3>Growth of the Digital Economy</h3>
        <p class="coding-desc">Today, people are spending more money online, which has shifted business
          emphasis to digital sources of revenue and digital channels. The growth of the digital economy
           has made people more familiar with digital products
          and services, which has driven companies to seek new competitive advantages in the digital space.
          But digital business has evolved into more than selling online; according to Accenture,
          “Digital businesses create competitive edges based on unique combinations of digital and
          physical resources. They do things that others cannot and in
          ways that build comparative advantage.” </p>

        <h3>Common Elements of a Digital Business</h3>
        <p class="eat-desc">There are several views on the exact definition of digital business
          from industry experts. Gartner says that digital business is the creation of new value
           chains and business opportunities that traditional businesses cannot offer. McKinsey
            emphasizes that “digital should be seen less as a thing and more a way of doing things.”
      Most digital businesses fit one or both of these points; they focus on creating value at
     new frontiers for their core business, or they use digital technology to drive growth,
      revenue and performance in ways that were impossible with traditional models.
    It may be helpful for companies to review common elements of digital business and
      compare them against their own business models. These are some of the trends that differentiate
      digital from traditional processes. </p>
